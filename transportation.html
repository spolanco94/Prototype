                <h3>Transportation</h3>
                <p>Almost all visitors arrive to Taniti by air, though some arrive on a small cruise ship that docks in Yellow Leaf Bay for one night per week. Below are some common concerns about traveling around the island:</p>
                <div class="transportation-summary">
                    <ul>
                        <li>Taniti is served by a small airport that can accommodate small jets and propeller planes.</li>
                        <li>Taniti is in the process of expanding the airport so larger jets will be able to land on the island within the next few years.</li>
                        <li><strong>Merriton Landing:</strong> Taniti City is fairly flat and very walkable. Many tourists stay in this area as it is easy to explore on foot.</li>
                    </ul>
